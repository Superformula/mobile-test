# Super Scanner

Super Scanner is a Flutter app for generating and scanning QR Codes.

## Getting Started

If you don't have Flutter installed, the best way to get the project up and running is following the official documentation steps:

- [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

Once you have Flutter setup, in the app directory run:

```
flutter pub get
```

Then open Android Studio and hit the play button.

ps: you may need to set your Apple developer account and certificates if you want to run the app in a real iPhone device.
