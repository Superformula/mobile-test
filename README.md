# Superformula Mobile Developer Coding Test

* Full project and Readme file are found [here](./qr_generator)

## Requirements

There is only one test here currently, please review and get back to us.

## What We Care About

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real production App. Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

_We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result._

Here's what you should strive for:

- Good use of structure, security, and performance best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.

## Q&A

> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. There is no deadline for this task unless otherwise noted to you directly.

> What if I have a question?

Just create a new issue in this repo and we will respond and get back to you quickly.

## Review
The coding challenge is a take-home test upon which we'll be conducting a thorough code review once complete. The review will consist of meeting some more of our mobile engineers and giving a review of the solution you have designed. Please be prepared to share your screen and run/demo the application to the group. During this process, the engineers will be asking questions.
